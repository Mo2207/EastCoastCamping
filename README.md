## 📖 Description

EastCoastCamping is a full-stack web application built with React and GraphQL that allows users to explore and book local campgrounds across the east coast of New Brunswick.

The platform focuses exclusively on regional campsites—offering a curated booking experience for users who want to discover, favorite, and reserve campgrounds all in one place.

The backend is powered by a secure GraphQL API with Express and MongoDB, while the frontend delivers a smooth interface built in React and styled with Bootstrap.

- Our motivation for this project was to combat the lack of websites that feature exclusively local campgrounds on the east coast.  
- While building this project we learned how to use GraphQL with MongoDB, and create dynamic interfaces using React components.
