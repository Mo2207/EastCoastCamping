## Description:
  
A React application that uses Graphql and a mongodb database. It allows users to create accounts, search for campgrounds, 
add camps to favorites, look at reviews, and make a reservations.
  - Our motivation for this project was to combat the lack of websites that feature exclusively local campgrounds on the east coast. 
  - Building this project we learned how to use graphql with our mongodb database, and use React components.
